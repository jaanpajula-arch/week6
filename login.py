# Login system simulation

# Store the correct password (python123) in a variable.
# Create a Boolean variable logged_in and set it to False.
# Use a while loop to keep asking the user for a password while logged_in is False.
# If the password is correct, change logged_in to True and display "Login successful!".
# If the password is incorrect, display "Incorrect password. Try again". and ask again.
# Important: The user has an unlimited number of attempts. The program should stop asking for a password only after a successful login.
